# Gun Assembly
## Development status
*This is a BETA release.*

I've just started to revive [Gun Assembly](http://community.playstarbound.com/resources/gun-assembly.2125/), at the moment, only "__Assault rifles__" are suported.

My intention is to add all vanilla random generated melee and ranged weapons before full release (Steam Whorshop), at the moment, I need people to toy with it and to point me any bug/quirk you encounter.
